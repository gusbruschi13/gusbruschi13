Data Scientist.

I have been working with data for 6 years, I continue to achieve my main objective: to create and develop experiences that transform people's lives. I have a degree in Economics at [UFABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/), with a focus on Econometrics. In the market I learned about Machine Learning, fell in love and decided to study on my own.

I have knowledge in regression, classification, time series, clustering and I am studying causal inference. Always learning new knowledge, currently focused on learning ML/MLOps Engineering and Behavioral Economics. I applied this expertise in the innovation of several industries such as finance, healthcare and ecommerce. I also wrote some articles about data science on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gustavobruschi13).

â€‘ Tools: R, Python, SQL, Spark, Git, Docker, Airflow/Composer, Databricks, Sagemaker, Kubeflow, QGIS
