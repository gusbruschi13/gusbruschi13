Data Scientist.

I've been working with data for 7 years, I continue to achieve my main goal: to create and develop experiences that transform people's lives. I have a degree in Economics from [UFABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/), emphasizing Econometrics. In the job market, I learned about Machine Learning, fell in love with it, and decided to study independently.

I've knowledge in regression techniques, classification, time series, clustering, and experimentation/causal inference, both in Python and R. I also have experience in SQL for performing ETLs. I'm always looking to study new things. Currently, I'm focused on learning: Operations Research, to improve decision-making processes with data and optimization; ML Engineering/MLOps, to deploy models at scale; and even Behavioral Psychology/Economics, because I'm curious about how human beings make decisions.

I have applied this experience to innovating across industries like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. I also wrote some articles about data science on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gustavobruschi13).
